What is Ozy?
------------

Ozy is a PHP and Javascript tool which gives you the ablility to execute client side 
Javascript code from your server side PHP application.

Ozy is inspired from libraries like [XAJAX][1] and [Phery][2] but in mind that in modern frameworks 
it showld operates outside custom PHP functions. In theory you can use Ozy in any php file, 
front controller, controller action or whatever.

If you use PHP framework as [Symfony][3] or [Zend][4] you can implement Ozy as a response class in order 
to fit it in the framework super natively.

jQuery integration
------------------

Ozy maps all [jQuery][5] functions available, which means it can operates with whatever version on [jQuery][5] you have - 
old or future one
